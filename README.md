# FABIII-Drupal-Module

WordPress Plugin publishig Member States' bailiffs data

Development of an open-source Drupal Module publishing real-time data to the FAB Directory. 

This solution aims to satisfy the integration of National Registries with existing CMS frameworks but without having REST API capabilities, in order to connect to the FAB Directory. The Plugin builds the REST API endpoints upon the existing WordPress installation.

In order for the Module to be used, the parameters should be edited based on the installation's **custom content types** and the **fields**.
